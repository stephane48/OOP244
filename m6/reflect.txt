During this milestones it was given to me to realize a parking application to fill 
the information of a vehicle in a file and save the updates.

Throughout this project, I learned a lot:
-First, it is often necessary to implement the destructor in a base class as virtual, 
even if no class is currently derived from this base class, which guarantees that the most 
derived destructor will be called and that it it is not necessary to pass to the definition
 of the base class when a class is derived from the base class.

-Secondly, I learned that to eliminate the duplication of logic in 
the whole hierarchical system we made use of polymorphism.

Finally, this project was not easy because the instructions were not precise; 
therefore I had great difficulty understanding the role of each function.

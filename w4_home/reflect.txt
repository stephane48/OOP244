I've learnt to  do not trust Visual Code (VS) and to empty my char arrays. As well, 
I've learnt how to use strlen, cause I haven't used it before; how to overload 
constructors and set empty state for the validation purposes. In addiation, still 
learn how to include comments and documentations in my code. And I've learnt to do 
not forget to input "const" to query functions,which don't modify data.

Futhermore, in my set function I had a problm when I tried to allocate a dynamically memory
to m_name because for the size of the dynamic memory i did'nt increase by 1 so i got a
memory leak because of that.

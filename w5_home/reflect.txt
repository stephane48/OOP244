In this workshop 5, I found a lot of difficulty and those difficulties learnt a lot of things.
Firstly, I have learned how to overload operators and use them in other overloaded operator definitions 
to reduce code duplication and keep cleaner and crisp code. 

Moreover, I have also learned to appreciate how overloaded operators can make coding faster, 
more convenient and easier to read. I also learned how to do logical calculations thorugh operator overload, 
such as comparing if two objects are equal by overloadint the '==' operator.

Subsequently, I learned that objects can be created temporarily through the execution of another object's member functions, 
in which case the temporary object will cease existing by the end of the function lifetime.

Finally, the issues that i had in this workshop, was about to avoid memory leak, but i solved it by deleting my memory after used it;
the second was about the bits character because when i was copying the odl array inside the new array my for loop was endless.

I found this workshop difficult to understand the instructions expecially DIY and really hard to execute, 
having more "trouble" with the instructions than with the code.

That being said, the concept of pointers and references still eludes me somehow, so I had some trouble 
figuring out the last overload function '+=' as it has to work with a pointer 'this' and return a reference of the object.

1. The reason for allocating a new set of dynamic memory is because that original
set of memory is operated for that specific array. Meaning, that memory is fitted 
for to match the size need for that array. By creating a new dynamic memory, we are 
creating the required space that we need for the new array.

2. The reason for not deleting the memory for specific variables such as name or even
population is because each variable is stored within the structure Kingdom. By deleting
the space of memory that we used for the Kingdom structure any data that we used or 
even entered will be deleted and or erased. New data can then be stored using the same 
structure, using a different size.

3. By using two display functions in our program we using a term called function overload. 
This term means that we are using the exact same function multiple times in our code but 
we are altering the function so that we can pass different parameters instead of the one
used. When compiling a program, the compiler will look at both the function, the function 
prototype, the parameters being sent and most importantly the call. The complier will pinpoint
which function to use by the amount of parameters being sent, we can then use this to figure
out which function these parameters line up to. 

4. I've learned two things while doing this workshop, the reason for allocating memory and function
overload. The reason for allocating is so that we can create a block of data in the memory that we 
can within the system. This memory is set at a specific size so that we won't have to waste any
unused memory. Function overload can be used by declaring a function with the similar purpose with the
exact same variable name. We use function overload so we can have similar functions in our code 
but take in different parameters instead.

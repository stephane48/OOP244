In this workshop 7, I found a lot of difficulty and those difficulties learnt a lot of things.

First,  I learnt that how to call a constructo in another construction to fill an object properly,
but on this part I had difficulties because I called the Vehhicle() constructor without setting that
as a public member in the car() constructor. 

Second, I learnt that we can not call a constructor within a function, while we can a constructor
within another constructor because I try that and It broke code. 

Finally, this workshop was not so confusing because we did not have to deal with dynamic memory which 
appeals memory leak, so that is why I did not get too much issues to find the solutions.

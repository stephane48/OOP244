1- Sometimes having undifined values cause various bugs and the safiest 
to avoid that is to set variables in empty state. Moreover, to indicate that 
variable do not have data, we assigne empty state as 0 for int and "\0" for char.

2- Structures are basically puclic and do not have private data inside, therefore
we can access all data without needing anything member function. While, classes have 
private data and public at the point that, if we have access private data, we have to
use the member functions which are public data.

3- In entreprise, we use a lot of data and we have to hide data of the clients, and the 
better way is to use classes because clients' data will not be accessible by everybody 
because they will be private. In addition, because we do not want to lose the private 
data or to break them classes are much more safer data to do that.

4- In this workshop, I learned mamy things as follow:
-I learned how to use the operator or keyword "this" to holds the address of the current
object
-How to built another member functions in cargo to access private data inside cargo
(e.g. fixe and take)
-How to make that no variables have unexpected values by using empty state
